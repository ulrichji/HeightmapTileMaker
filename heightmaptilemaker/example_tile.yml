# The geocoordinates of the top left of the tile (0,0 coordinate) in the same format as the tiff files.
# Note that this is not necessarily Lat-long coordinates. Example dataset is UTM33
geo-top-left:
    east: 513428

# This is the actual distance between the top-left and top-right points
# This is required to scale the height of the heightmap accordingly.
# The unit of this value must then be the same as the unit of the height
# in the tiff files. This value can typically be found by some mapping
# tool that can compute distance between two points in geo-coordinates.
# In this example, the height is measured in meters.
geo-distance: 6960

# The size of the tile relative to the geo-top-left and geo-top-right.
# The base distance between geo-top-left and geo-top-right is 1,
# so this is a scaling factor.
# This is optional and defaults to 1
size: 9

# Note that this parameter can be overridden by input arguments to the

# This is the number of points in x direction of the tile mesh.

# This is the thickness. This should be in the same unit as the size paramter.
# This defaults to size/10. Note that this is measured from the zero-level of the
# tile (typically sea-level when height is measured in meters on standard maps)
